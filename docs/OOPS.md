OOPS

Encapsulation
Inheritance
Abstraction
Polymorphism


Encapsulation is about protecting the properties and functionality of an object from another object.
Encapuslation we use a class, data -> properties or variables, functionality -> methods or functions.
Writing the data and code into once single unit.

Inheritance is the process of defining a new object with the help of an existing object.
Accessing existing object functionality
Update existing object functionality

Reusability and is-a relationship.

Abstraction is about hiding all unneccasry details of an object and only showing essential features which other object need to communicate with it. Eg: TV and Remote, Car, Laptop 

Polymorphism
Poly -> multi morphism -> shapes / behaviour
An indiviual behaves differently different behaviour.
Same object behaves differently when communicating with other object.
